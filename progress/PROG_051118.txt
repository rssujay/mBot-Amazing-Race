  Having trouble with the band pass filter
    >> not detecting changes in frequency?
    >> will have to redo the circuit
  
  Created function for detecting colour from the colour sensor
    >> needs 6 different colours
      >> red, blue, green, orange, white, black
    >> mainly uses if-else statements (possible to use switch..case?)

      >> for each colour, obtains colour values
      >> divides by 1023 and multiplies by 255
