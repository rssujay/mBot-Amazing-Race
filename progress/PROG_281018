	- Discussing how to make the mBot turn
		>> Move one wheel vs moving both wheels in different direction
			>> Decided on moving both wheels in different directions
		>> Both motors are identical
			>> Motor.speed() values must be opposite signed (-/+) in order for the mBot
			   to move forward
				>> Hence to turn, values must be identically signed
		>> When mBot encounters a black strip, immediately turn and go?
		>> Double left/right turn?
			>> When mBot encounters a wall, store value from the ultrasonic sensor in a var
			>> After turn, and encounter next wall, when value from ultrasonic sensor == var, turn
				
	- Error Correction
		>> 2 sources of error
			>> Human error from placing the mBot on the ground
			>> Error from the mBot turning
		>> What happens if the mBot turns badly (thus having an angle to hit a wall)
			>> Idea 1: using IR sensor on the side?
				>> Calculate distance from sides of mBot to the wall
				>> Using a different threshold, correct angle accordingly
				>> How to consider for different angles of attack?
					>> Using math method to calculate the angle of attack?
						>> Using distance calculated by the IR sensor at t = 0s vs t = 30s
						>> If distance at t = 30s is less than t = 0s, angle can be determined and corrected
				>> How to consider when there is no side wall during the turn?
					>> 2nd Correction
						>> When a wall is detected on the sides, then correct accordingly
	
	/** ACHIEVED TODAY **/
	>> Made mBot turn 90deg
	>> Made mBot move forward and backward
	>> Made mBot spaz around :)
	>> Wrote skeleton code
